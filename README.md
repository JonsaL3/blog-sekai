# Sekai's Blog - A little school project ðŸŽ’

## What is Sekai? ðŸ¤”

Sekai is a blog that allows users to make blog entries and browse through other users' entries.
It is designed as a CMS, so anyone can download it and create their own blog.

By default, there will be only one user, which will be the administrator (admin:admin) who will have the ability to add and remove users.

On the other hand, users will be able to create and modify their own blog entries.

Note, the first time you run it you will have to open the /install page, which will create the database automatically.
